> A full-stack anonymous feedback platform with OTP authentication, real-time messaging, and AI-powered suggestions.

## About

**Unsaid** lets anyone receive honest, anonymous feedback through a unique shareable link. Users sign up, verify via OTP, and get a personal page where others can drop messages — no login required for senders. AI-powered suggestions help message senders express themselves when words are hard to find.

## Features

- **Anonymous Messaging** — Anyone can send feedback without creating an account.
- **OTP Authentication** — Secure email-based verification for recipients.
- **AI-Powered Suggestions** — Smart message prompts to help senders craft thoughtful feedback.
- **Shareable Profile Links** — Each user gets a unique URL to collect messages.
- **Real-Time Dashboard** — View and manage incoming messages instantly.
- **Responsive Design** — Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile.
